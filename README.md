[![Rust](https://github.com/mach-kernel/launchk/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mach-kernel/launchk/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive) TUI that makes XPC queries & helps manage launchd jobs.

#### Install

Binaries are available via brew tap:

```
brew tap mach-kernel/pkgs
brew install mach-kernel/pkgs/launchk
```

#### Features

Use `:` to enter command mode, `/` to enter filtering mode, and any of `sguadl` for filtering by [system, global, user, agent, daemon, loaded]. `Ctrl-U` to clear, `Tab` to complete, `Enter` to submit. 

- Poll XPC for jobs and display changes as they happen
- Filter by `LaunchAgents` and `LaunchDaemons` in scopes (fsnotify watched):
  - System (/System/Library/)
  - Global (/Library)
  - User (~/) 
- `bootstrap`
- `bootout`
- `dumpstate` (opens in `$PAGER`)
- `dumpjpcategory` (opens in `$PAGER`)
- `procinfo` (opens in `$PAGER`, does not require root!)
- `edit` plist in `$EDITOR` with support for binary plists
- `csrinfo` show all CSR flags and their values

#### xpc-sys

While building launchk, XPC convenience glue was placed in `xpc-sys`. 

[[See its README here]](xpc-sys/README.md)
